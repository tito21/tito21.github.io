Welcome to my blog, my name is Alberto Di Biase, and I'm biomedical engineer from
Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile, currently working at Imperial College
London on Cardiac diffusion MRI. In this blog, I write about artificial
intelligence, maths and healthcare.

If you are interested, here is my [CV](https://github.com/tito21/resume/releases/latest/download/CV.pdf).
And for if you have any questions, feel free to contact me at asdibiase at uc.cl.
